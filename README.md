# Title: Development of a Dedicated Question Answering System for Pregnant Women and Neonates Using COVID-19 Literature

## Project Overview

This data analysis project aimed to construct a specialized question answering system tailored for pregnant women and neonates amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The project utilized data analysis techniques, particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), to develop a robust framework for precise information retrieval from COVID-19 literature. The system was designed to cater to the unique information needs of this vulnerable demographic by delivering accurate and reliable answers within the medical domain.

## Objective

The primary objective was to address the challenges of information retrieval related to pregnant women and neonates amid the vast corpus of COVID-19 literature. Existing question answering systems often lacked specificity and accuracy when providing answers pertinent to this specialized domain. This project aimed to bridge this gap by implementing a data-driven approach to develop a dedicated system catering to the unique needs of pregnant women and neonates during the pandemic.

## Methodology

The methodology involved leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). These techniques were integrated into a unique pipeline architecture to embed domain-specific information related to pregnant women and neonates. This approach enabled the system to retrieve precise and contextually relevant answers from the extensive COVID-19 literature.

## Results

The data analysis project successfully developed a specialized question answering system designed specifically for pregnant women and neonates using COVID-19 literature. The system demonstrated the capability to retrieve targeted documents and sections relevant to queries related to this vulnerable demographic. Evaluation metrics confirmed the accuracy and reliability of the system's responses compared to existing methodologies, emphasizing its effectiveness in addressing the unique information needs of pregnant women and neonates during the pandemic.

## Conclusion

The successful construction of a data-driven question answering system underscores the potential of leveraging data analysis techniques, particularly NLP, to create domain-specific solutions within the medical domain. The specialized system tailored for pregnant women and neonates offers a reliable and accurate approach for information retrieval from COVID-19 literature, catering to the distinct needs of this vulnerable demographic.
